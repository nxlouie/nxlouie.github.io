When someone comes across new information, they will try to piece it together in a way that makes sense. This is a /narrative/, “a spoken or written account of connected events; a story.” Once you start looking for narratives, you’ll find them everywhere. A police investigation and the subsequent prosecution is a narrative. It attempts to recreate the series of events to maximize the guilty defendant narrative. A Hinge dating profile linearly arranges a series of achievements, travel experiences, and aspirations, providing the SparkNotes of who you could be dating. This is also a narrative.

In professional settings, there are numerous situations where your primary job is to deliver a compelling narrative of a situation you had a part in. Sometimes, you won’t even be aware of what’s expected of you. Other times, you unknowingly self-sabotage your narrative, with predictable results.

## Comparative Narrative
Resume writing can be a source of angst because it forces you to qualify yourself as a person. This process involves thinking of your “major achievements” of your past experiences.

A problem with writing about “major achievements” is that by nature, most day-to-day tasks are mundane. A software engineer spends hours figuring out why a button is green instead of blue. A digital marketer spends hours perfectly aligning text in a Powerpoint presentation. In actually doing the work, you have broken down the overall experience into a collection of small tasks that don’t seem that exciting. How can your experiences coloring buttons possibly compare to those of the “real deal” people in your field, seemingly changing the world?

There’s two scenarios:
1. The “real deal” person’s background and experiences are strictly more impactful than yours. Directly comparing yourself to others is a rat race, and you’ll always find a faster rat. The best thing to do here is direct your efforts more thoughtfully in the future.
2. Their work is just as pedestrian as yours, but they communicated it in a compelling manner. 7 Habits author Stephen Covey says that “we judge ourselves based on our intentions and others by their actions.” A corollary to this statement is that “We judge ourselves based on how we experience our work, and others by how we perceive their work.” It’s easy to get lost in the weeds of our own experiences, and see the wider narrative of others.

Chances are, it’s some combination of the two.

## Presentation of Self
The past is a series of events that has already happened, and is unchangeable. However, the presentation of the past can continually be reformed towards new goals (this is why history continues to be a major academic field). Though you may not have been thinking about your overall narrative while driving the events of your past, You’ll need to work with what you have and form a compelling narrative from your collection of experiences.

Life is complex, and you’re pulled in many distracting (or exploratory) directions along the way. It looks something like this:



In interviews, the interviewee’s job is delivering a narrative that everything in their life has been led up to this moment of being the most uniquely qualified candidate for the job. There’s two strategies for achieving this goal:



Adaptation. The data point needs to be adapted to fit the attempted narrative. At first glance, a summer job at McDonald’s may not have much to do with a finance job interview. However, delivering a narrative of dedication to efficiency and throughput, and emphasizing the learnings of the way McDonald’s tracks food wastage signals the correct mindset was developed. 
Exclusion. This strategy is useful when there’s more than enough data points. Here, it’s better to trim off events that otherwise would’ve been adapted, because too many events ultimately get in the way of delivering the strongest, clearest narrative.

Finally, the audience usually did not have the opportunity to experience the events conveyed. Thus, the entire delivery is conveyed through your experiences. If your delivery is negative, then the perception is most likely negative. The perception of the narrative is combined with the interviewer’s perception of the reliability of the narrator to form a final narrative within the audience on how great you are for the job.

## Proactive Storytelling
A narrative can be formed from any past. It is beneficial to have a general idea of where you want to go before and during the work that is supposed to get you there. Your present experiences are very much like being in the middle of writing a novel. The more of an idea of the major plot points you want to reach, the easier time you’ll have applying your current situation to that.

Once again, I recognize that life is complex. In this sense, you may not know the final stage of your career. Thus, we apply the model of the television sitcom to career management. In The Office, the show writers probably knew that Jim ends up with Pam in the end. How they got there was a synthesis of practical realities, such as cast availability and season-by-season demand. Writing your “season” of a job experience involves thinking ahead to what your next season will look like.

## Narrative Everything
Everything is a narrative. The public relations field is an exercise in narrative management. Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Shiller has made his latest professional fame on Narrative Economics - how narratives and information virality drive the direction of the economy. Storytelling is fundamental to the world that we live in, and your career is no different.
