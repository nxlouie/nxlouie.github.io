Last year, the Michigan Daily released the [Grade Guide Distribution Tool][grade-guide], which displays the grade distributions of all LSA courses. It helped students make informed decisions about their education, and I was thoroughly impressed with how inuitive and useful the tool was. When I heard that the Web Team was recruiting, I jumped at the chance to have a similar impact.

&nbsp; 

One aspect of the Daily's website I think could be improved is improving the organization of these web apps. When I first used the Grade Distribution tool, I immediately tried to find other useful apps by the Daily, and I just couldn't find any. Assuming there are other discrete web apps on the site, my suggestion would be to release more useful data visualizations, and add a section on the site to collect them all in one place (Instead of putting it in "/section/no-section/").
