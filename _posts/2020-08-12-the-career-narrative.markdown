When we come across new information, we try to piece it together in a way that makes sense. This is a narrative, “a spoken or written account of connected events; a story.” We are most familiar with narratives presented in novels or Netflix shows. We are less familiar with the narratives present in our careers.

In those careers, there are numerous situations where we are expected to deliver a compelling narrative of a situation we had a part in. Sometimes, we aren't even aware of what’s expected of us. Other times, we unknowingly sabotage our narratives in activities like resume writing, interviewing, or career planning.

## Comparative Narrative
Resume writing can be a source of angst because it forces us to justify how worthy we are as professionals. This process involves coming up with the “major achievements” of our past experiences.

A problem with writing about “major achievements” is that by nature, most day-to-day tasks are mundane. A software engineer spends hours figuring out why a button is green instead of blue. A digital marketer spends hours perfectly aligning text in a Powerpoint presentation. In actually doing the work, we have broken down the overall experience into a collection of small tasks that don’t seem that exciting. How can our experiences coloring buttons possibly compare to those of the “real deal” people in our fields, seemingly changing the world every day?

There’s two scenarios:
1. The “real deal” person’s background and experiences are strictly more impactful than ours. Directly comparing ourselve's to others is a rat race, and we’ll always find a faster rat. The best thing to do here is direct our efforts more thoughtfully in the future.
2. Their work is just as pedestrian as ours, but they communicated it in a compelling manner. Stephen Covey of *7 Habits* fame states that “we judge ourselves based on our intentions and others by their actions.” A corollary to this statement is that “We judge ourselves based on how we experience our work, and others by how we perceive their work.” It’s easy to consume others' compelling narratives while getting lost in the weeds of our own work.

Most times it's the latter, or some combination of both.

## Presentation of Self
The past is a series of events that has already happened, and is unchangeable. However, the presentation of the past can continually be reformed towards new goals. Though we may not have been thinking about our overall narrative while living our past experiences, we’ll need to work with what we have and form a compelling narrative from the collection of experiences.

Life is complex, and we’re pulled in many distracting (or exploratory) directions along the way. It looks something like this:

In interviews, the interviewee’s job is delivering a narrative that everything in their life has been led up to this moment of being the most uniquely qualified candidate for the job. There’s two strategies for achieving this goal:

**Adaptation**. The data point needs to be adapted to fit the attempted narrative. At first glance, a summer job at McDonald’s may not have much to do with a finance job interview. However, delivering a narrative of dedication to efficiency and throughput, and emphasizing the learnings of the way McDonald’s tracks food wastage signals the correct mindset was developed.

**Exclusion**. This strategy is useful when there’s more than enough data points. Here, it’s better to trim off events that otherwise would’ve been adapted, because too many events ultimately get in the way of delivering the strongest, clearest narrative. McDonald's just isn't that relevant when there's other finance and banking experiences to pick from.

The audience probably did not have the opportunity to experience the events conveyed. Our interviewers usually weren't watching us work our past jobs. Thus, the entire delivery is conveyed through our experiences. If our delivery is negative, then the perception is most likely negative. The perception of the narrative is combined with the interviewer’s perception of the reliability of the narrator to form their own, final narrative on how great we are for the job.

## Proactive Storytelling
A narrative can be formed from any past. It is beneficial to have a general idea of where we want to go before and during the work that is supposed to get us there. Our present experiences are very much like being in the middle of writing a novel. The more of an idea of the major plot points we want to reach, the easier time we’ll have applying our current situation to that.

Life is complex. We probably don't know the final stage of our careers. Thus, television sitcoms could be more applicable than novel writing when it comes to career management. In *The Office*, the show writers probably knew that Jim ends up with Pam in the end. How they got there was a synthesis of practical realities, such as cast availability and season-by-season demand. Writing our “season” of a job experience involves thinking ahead to what our next couple seasons could look like.

## Narrative Everything
Once we start looking for narratives, we can find them everywhere. A police investigation and the subsequent prosecution is a narrative. It attempts to recreate the series of events to maximize the guilty defendant narrative. A Hinge dating profile linearly arranges a series of achievements, travel experiences, and aspirations, providing the SparkNotes of our potential date. Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Shiller has taken this idea to the highest level, and made his latest professional fame on *Narrative Economics* - how narratives and information virality drive the direction of the economy. Storytelling is fundamental to the world that we live in, and our careers are no different.
