  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>My name is Nathan Louie, and I am a current junior at the <a href="http://umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> school of engineering. This summer I will be interning at Goldman Sachs <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/why-goldman-sachs/our-divisions/technology/" target="_blank">Technology Division</a>. I am also looking for a highly technical internship for the Fall or Winter of 2017-2018. If you are interested, here is my <a href="img/nathanLouieResume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a>!</p>

  <p>I am passionate about Computer Science because of the innate amount of collaboration involved in the discipline. I appreciate the idea that writing good, reusable code involves both in-depth technical knowledge, and teamwork skills in order to work effectively.</p>
