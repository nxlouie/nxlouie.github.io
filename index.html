  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>My name is Nathan Louie, and I am a rising senior at the <a href="http://umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> College of Engineering. I am currently a Fall intern at Yelp in San Francisco. Last summer, I interned at Goldman Sachs Engineering division. I am also looking for a software engineering internship for Summer 2018.</p>

  <p>I am passionate about Computer Science because of the innate amount of collaboration involved in the discipline. I appreciate the idea that writing good, reusable code involves both in-depth technical knowledge, and teamwork skills in order to work effectively.</p>
